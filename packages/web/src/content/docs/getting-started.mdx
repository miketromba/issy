issy is an **AI-native issue tracking system**. It gives your AI coding assistant the ability to manage issues using natural language. Issues are stored as markdown files in `.issy/issues/` — readable, diffable, and committed with your code.

No database. No accounts. No vendor lock-in.

## How it works

Install the AI skill, then talk to your assistant naturally:

> "Create a bug for the login redirect issue, high priority"

> "What issues are open?"

> "Close the auth bug, it's fixed"

> "What should I work on next?"

Your assistant creates, searches, updates, and closes issues for you. Everything is stored as plain markdown files in your repository.

## Quick start

**1. Install issy globally:**

```bash
npm install issy --global
```

**2. Initialize issues in your project:**

```bash
issy init --seed
```

**3. Install the AI skill:**

```bash
issy skill install
```

That's it. Your AI assistant can now manage issues in any repo. Head to the [Installation](/docs/installation) page for more options, or learn about the [AI Skill](/docs/ai-skill) to understand what your assistant can do.
