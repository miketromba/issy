issy can be installed both globally **and** in your repository. We recommend both for the best experience — global for convenience, local for version pinning.

## Global installation

A global install brings flexibility and speed to your local workflows.

```bash
# npm
npm install issy --global

# pnpm
pnpm add issy --global

# yarn
yarn global add issy

# bun
bun install issy --global
```

Once installed globally, run commands from your terminal:

```bash
issy                          # Start the web UI
issy list                     # List open issues (roadmap order)
issy next                     # Show next issue to work on
issy create --title "Bug"     # Create an issue
```

## Repository installation

When collaborating with other developers, pin the version by adding issy as a `devDependency`:

```bash
# npm
npm install issy --save-dev

# pnpm
pnpm add issy --save-dev --ignore-workspace-root-check

# yarn
yarn add issy --dev --ignore-workspace-root-check

# bun
bun add issy --dev
```

You can continue using your global installation to run commands. Global `issy` automatically defers to the local version if one exists.

## Initialize a project

Create the `.issy/issues/` directory in your project:

```bash
issy init
```

Add `--seed` to create a welcome issue that demonstrates the format:

```bash
issy init --seed
```

## Install the AI skill

The AI skill lets your coding assistant manage issues through natural language:

```bash
issy skill install
```

Or, without installing `issy` first:

```bash
npx skills add miketromba/issy
```

## Verify installation

Check that everything is working:

```bash
issy --version
```

## Migrating from v0.4

If upgrading from v0.4.x (which used `.issues/` instead of `.issy/`):

```bash
issy migrate
```

This moves your issues to `.issy/issues/` and assigns roadmap order to all open issues.
