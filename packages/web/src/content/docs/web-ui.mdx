issy includes a local web UI for browsing issues visually. It's a read-write interface that runs in your browser.

## Launching

Run `issy` without any arguments:

```bash
issy
```

This starts a local server at `http://localhost:1554`. The port can be configured with the `ISSUES_PORT` environment variable.

```bash
ISSUES_PORT=3000 issy
```

## Features

The web UI provides:

- **Issue list** — Browse all issues with priority, status, type, and label badges
- **Search and filter** — Use the query bar with issy's query language
- **Issue detail** — Read full issue content with rendered markdown
- **Create, edit, and close** — Manage issues directly from the browser
- **Roadmap order** — Issues are sorted by roadmap position by default

## Query language

The search bar supports issy's query language for filtering:

```
is:open                      # Open issues only
is:closed                    # Closed issues only
priority:high                # High priority
type:bug                     # Bugs only
scope:large                  # Large scope
label:frontend               # Issues with "frontend" label
```

Combine filters:

```
is:open priority:high type:bug
```

Free text search also works — just type keywords and issy will fuzzy-match against issue titles and content.

## API

The web UI is backed by a REST API that you can also use programmatically:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/issues` | GET | List issues (supports `q` query parameter) |
| `/api/issues/:id` | GET | Get a single issue |
