description: How issy works in monorepo setups with automatic directory resolution.
order: 10

issy is designed to work seamlessly in monorepos. It automatically walks up from the current directory to find the `.issy/` folder, so you can run commands from any subdirectory.

## How it works

When you run any `issy` command, it:

1. Checks the current directory for `.issy/`
2. If not found, walks up to parent directories
3. Uses the first `.issy/` directory it finds

This means issues are typically stored at the repository root, and every package/subdirectory shares the same issue tracker.

## Example structure

```
my-monorepo/
  .issy/                 # ← issy finds this automatically
    issues/
      0001-fix-auth.md
      0002-add-feature.md
    on_create.md
    on_update.md
    on_close.md
  packages/
    frontend/            # ← `issy list` works here
    backend/             # ← and here
    shared/              # ← and here
```

## Usage from subdirectories

```bash
cd packages/frontend
issy list               # Finds and uses ../../.issy/
issy next               # Same — resolves to root .issy/
```

No special configuration needed. All commands resolve to the same issues directory regardless of where you run them.

## Best practices

- **Keep `.issy/` at the repo root** — This is the most common and recommended setup
- **One issue tracker per repo** — Avoid placing `.issy/` in subdirectories unless you specifically want separate trackers
- **Use `ISSY_DIR`** — If you need to override resolution, set the `ISSY_DIR` environment variable to an explicit path

## Multiple issue trackers

If you need separate issue trackers for different packages (uncommon), you can place `.issy/` directories in subdirectories:

```
my-monorepo/
  packages/
    frontend/
      .issy/             # Frontend-specific issues
        issues/
    backend/
      .issy/             # Backend-specific issues
        issues/
```

In this case, each subdirectory resolves to its own `.issy/`. This is an advanced pattern — most teams should use a single tracker at the root.
