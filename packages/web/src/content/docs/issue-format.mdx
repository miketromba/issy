description: How issy stores issues as markdown files with YAML frontmatter.
order: 6
---

Issues are stored as individual markdown files in `.issy/issues/`. Each file has YAML frontmatter for metadata and a markdown body for details.

## File structure

```
.issy/
  issues/
    0001-fix-login-redirect.md
    0002-add-dark-mode.md
    0003-export-issues-csv.md
  on_create.md    # Optional hook
  on_update.md    # Optional hook
  on_close.md     # Optional hook
```

Filenames follow the pattern `{id}-{slug}.md` where the ID is a zero-padded 4-digit number and the slug is derived from the title.

## Example issue

```markdown
---
title: Fix login redirect
priority: high
scope: medium
type: bug
status: open
order: a0
created: 2025-01-15T10:30:00

## Problem

After OAuth login, users are redirected to `/callback` but the
session isn't established, causing a redirect loop.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Click "Sign in with Google"
2. Complete OAuth flow
3. Observe redirect loop

## Expected behavior

User should land on dashboard after successful authentication.
```

## Frontmatter fields

| Field | Required | Values | Description |
|-------|----------|--------|-------------|
| `title` | Yes | string | Issue title |
| `priority` | Yes | `high`, `medium`, `low` | Priority level |
| `type` | Yes | `bug`, `improvement` | Issue type |
| `status` | Yes | `open`, `closed` | Current status |
| `order` | Auto | string | Fractional index key for roadmap position |
| `created` | Auto | ISO 8601 | Creation timestamp |
| `scope` | No | `small`, `medium`, `large` | Estimated effort |
| `labels` | No | comma-separated | Custom labels |

## Field details

### Priority

- **`high`** — Critical issues, blockers, or urgent fixes
- **`medium`** — Important but not blocking
- **`low`** — Nice to have, backlog items

### Type

- **`bug`** — Something is broken or not working as expected
- **`improvement`** — New feature, enhancement, or refactoring

### Scope

Scope is optional and indicates estimated effort:

- **`small`** — Quick fix, a few lines of code
- **`medium`** — A focused session of work
- **`large`** — Significant effort, possibly multiple sessions

### Labels

Free-form comma-separated strings for categorization:

```yaml
labels: frontend, auth, critical
```

### Order

The `order` field is a fractional index key managed by issy. It determines the issue's position in the [roadmap](/docs/roadmap-ordering). You should not edit this field manually.

## Body content

Everything after the frontmatter closing `---` is the issue body. Write standard markdown — headings, lists, code blocks, links, etc.

The body is fully rendered in the [Web UI](/docs/web-ui) and displayed as raw markdown when using `issy read`.
