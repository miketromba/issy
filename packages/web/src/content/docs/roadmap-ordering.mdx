title: Roadmap Ordering
description: How issy maintains a dependency-aware ordering of all open issues.
order: 7

issy maintains a **roadmap** — a strict, intentional ordering of all open issues. The roadmap reflects logical dependencies, so no issue should be blocked by one that follows it.

## How it works

Every open issue has a position in the roadmap determined by its `order` field. This field uses **fractional indexing** — a technique that allows inserting items between any two existing items without reindexing.

When you run `issy list`, issues appear in roadmap order by default. `issy next` always returns the first issue — the next thing to work on.

## Position flags

When creating or reopening an issue while other open issues exist, you **must** specify where it fits in the roadmap:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--before <id>` | Insert before a specific issue |
| `--after <id>` | Insert after a specific issue |
| `--first` | Insert at the beginning |
| `--last` | Insert at the end |

### Creating issues

```bash
issy create --title "Add auth" --after 0001       # After issue #0001
issy create --title "Fix bug" --before 0003        # Before issue #0003
issy create --title "Urgent" --first               # At the top
issy create --title "Backlog item" --last           # At the bottom
```

### Repositioning issues

Use position flags with `update` to move an existing issue:

```bash
issy update 0001 --first                           # Move to top
issy update 0001 --after 0003                      # Move after #0003
issy update 0001 --last                            # Move to bottom
```

### Reopening issues

When reopening a closed issue, you must also specify a position:

```bash
issy reopen 0001 --last
issy reopen 0001 --after 0004
```

## Choosing placement

Think about logical dependency when choosing position:

- If issue B requires work from issue A, A must come **before** B
- Place foundational/infrastructure work **early**
- Place user-facing features **later**
- Use `--first` for urgent work that should be tackled immediately
- Use `--last` when in doubt — it appends to the end

## Sorting alternatives

While roadmap order is the default, `issy list` supports other sort modes:

```bash
issy list --sort roadmap     # Default — roadmap order
issy list --sort priority    # By priority level
issy list --sort created     # By creation date
issy list --sort updated     # By last update
issy list --sort id          # By issue ID
```

## Technical details

The `order` field in issue frontmatter is a string key generated by the [fractional-indexing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fractional-indexing) library. Keys sort lexicographically, allowing new items to be inserted between any two existing items without modifying them.

You should not edit the `order` field manually. Use the position flags instead.
