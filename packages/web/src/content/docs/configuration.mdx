issy is designed to work with zero configuration. For cases where you need to customize behavior, environment variables are available.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `ISSY_DIR` | Path to the issy directory | `./.issy` |
| `ISSUES_PORT` | Port for the web UI server | `1554` |

### ISSY_DIR

Override the default `.issy` directory location:

```bash
ISSY_DIR=/path/to/custom/.issy issy list
```

This is useful when your issues directory is in a non-standard location.

### ISSUES_PORT

Change the port for the web UI server:

```bash
ISSUES_PORT=3000 issy
```

The web UI will then be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Directory resolution

By default, issy looks for `.issy/` in the current directory and walks upward through parent directories until it finds one. This means you can run commands from any subdirectory in your project.

See [Monorepo Support](/docs/monorepo) for details on how this works in monorepo setups.

## Version pinning

When collaborating, pin your issy version in `package.json`:

```bash
npm install issy --save-dev
```

Global `issy` automatically defers to the local version if one exists, ensuring everyone on the team uses the same version.
