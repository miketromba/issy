description: How to install and use the issy AI skill for natural language issue management.
order: 3
---

The AI skill is what makes issy special. Once installed, your AI coding assistant (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) can manage issues through plain English conversation.

## Installing the skill

```bash
issy skill install
```

Or, without installing `issy` first:

```bash
npx skills add miketromba/issy
```

The skill is installed into your project and is automatically picked up by compatible AI assistants.

## What the skill enables

With the skill installed, your assistant understands how to:

- **Create issues** with appropriate priority, type, scope, and roadmap position
- **List and search** open issues with filters and fuzzy matching
- **Read** full issue details including body content
- **Update** issue properties and reposition in the roadmap
- **Close** issues when work is complete
- **Reopen** issues when needed

## Natural language examples

Just talk to your assistant:

> "Create a high priority bug for the login crash"

> "What issues are open?"

> "Show me the next issue to work on"

> "Search for anything related to authentication"

> "Close issue 0001, the fix is deployed"

> "Create an improvement to add dark mode, put it after the auth work"

The assistant translates your intent into the appropriate `issy` CLI commands.

## How it works

The skill provides your AI assistant with:

1. **Context** about issy's CLI commands and their options
2. **Guidelines** for writing good issue descriptions
3. **Rules** for roadmap ordering and issue placement
4. **Best practices** for issue sizing, verification, and resolution notes

The assistant uses the `issy` CLI under the hood, so all operations produce the same markdown files as manual CLI usage.

## Issue authoring guidelines

The skill instructs your assistant to write issues that capture:

- **Problem/Overview** — What's wrong or what's needed
- **Proposed Solution** — High-level approach
- **Acceptance Criteria** — What "done" looks like (optional)
- **Verification** — How to prove the issue is resolved (optional but encouraged)

The assistant captures your intent without inventing implementation details. If you provide specific technical details, they'll be included. Otherwise, issues stay high-level.

## Verification guidance

The skill encourages including verification steps so implementing agents can prove work is complete:

```markdown
## Verification
Run `bun test src/auth.test.ts` — all tests should pass,
including the new "handles expired tokens" case.
```

```markdown
## Verification
After deployment, `curl https://api.example.com/health`
should return `{"status": "ok"}` with a 200 response.
```

## Closing issues with learnings

When closing an issue, the skill prompts the assistant to append a `## Resolution Notes` section if anything useful was discovered:

- Alternative approaches considered or rejected
- Unexpected gotchas or edge cases
- Decisions that differ from the original plan
- Useful context for future reference
